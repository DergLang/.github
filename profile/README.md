## About

Dorg (DorgLang) is a programming language built to compile into native-capable Luau via a stupidly fast transpiler written in Zig, Rust and C.

Dorg is inspired by TypeScript, Rust, Gleam, and a bunch of other languages!

It is currently mostly a solo project by [KnownSH](https://github.com/KnownSH) and the main compiler is not publically released yet.
